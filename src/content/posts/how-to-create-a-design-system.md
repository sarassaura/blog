       3. Saturation: The intensity of the color from vivid to grayish (toned)

    3. Color Scheme:

       1. Monochromatic: Used for minimal and less distracting designs.
       2. Analogous: Colors next to each other on the color wheel.
       3. Complimentary: Colors on the opposite side of the color wheel.
       4. Split-Complimentary: One primary color and two secondaries on the opposite side.
       5. Triadic: Forms a triangle on the color wheel.

    5. The 60/30/10 Rule

       1. The distribution of colors throughout the design should be 60% Primary color, 30% Secondary color and 10% Accent color. In case you have more colors with the same role then divide the percentages equally in respect to each role.
