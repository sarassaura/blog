1. **Every text should be in black with a white background**: The reason is that if the company were to print your resume then you can avoid issues with the printer, like if the colored ink is missing.

2. **Make it readable**: Don't use more than 2 or 3 fonts, and choose sans-serif ones.

3. **Professional photo**: Only put a photo if you have a really good one, it's recommended to hire a professional photographer, you need to be careful to show some personality but don't be too casual. Choose your clothes wisely, the way you present yourself is the first thing they will judge.

4. **Use templates**: If you're not a designer then you can use [Rxresu](https://rxresu.me/) or [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to get a ready-to-use template with good spacing, hierarchy and harmony out of the box, but don't forget to apply the other tips as well.

5. **Never show the level of your skills**: Your perception cannot be trusted and will probably be taken in the wrong way.

6. **Don't make inventive titles**: In case your resume has to pass through a bot, you need to use the same words everyone else is using, search for examples and don't forget to put 'experience'.

7. **Make it simple**: The focus should be on the text, recruiters will see a lot of resumes so don't make it overwhelming, the people who get interviews won't risk calling too much attention.
