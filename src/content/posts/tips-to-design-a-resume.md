1. **Every text should be in black with a white background**: The reason is because if the company were to print your resume then you can avoid issues with the printer, like if the colored ink is missing.

2. **Make it readable**: Don't use more than 2 or 3 fonts, and choose sans-serif ones.

3. **Professional photo**: Only put a photo if you have a good one, it's recommendable to invest in the photo with a professional photographer, you need to be careful to show some personality but not too casual. Choose your clothes wisely, the way you present yourself is the first thing they will judge so unless you have a good photo don't put any.

4. **Use templates**: If you're not a designer than you can use https://rxresu.me/ or https://www.canva.com/ to get a ready to use template with good spacing, hierarchy and harmony out of a box, but don't forget to apply the other tips as well.

5. **Never show the level of your skills**: Your perception about how much you know something cannot be trusted and will probably be taken in the wrong way.

6. **Make it simple**: The focus should be on the text, they will see a lot of resumes so don't make it overwhelming, the people who gets interviews won't risk by calling too much attention.
